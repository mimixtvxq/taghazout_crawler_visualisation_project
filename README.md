# taghazout_crawler_visualisation_project
Project for Earth System Data Class - Profesor Angelo Pio Rossi at Jacobs University. 

taghazout_surf_crawler.py contains the code for the crawler. The crawler is specifically designed for https://magicseaweed.com/spot-daily-history.php?spotId=131&month=1&day=30 .
To retrieve data for another spot that is not Taghazout Beach, please alter the spotId accordingly.

The inspiration behind this project is to aid Hakuna Matata Surf Hostel in Taghazout, Morocco with their operations due to personal connections with the owners, and the author's role as social media content manager in the business.

taghazout_surf_data.csv contains the data returned from the utilisation of the crawler.

Taghazout_Data_Overview_and_Exploration.ipynb contains the code for the computed statistics of the crawled data.

Taghazout_Swell_Data_Analysis.ipynb contains the code for the functions fit to the crawled data to observe trends.

The Images_World directory contains .png image files of the NWW3 GRiB file visualisations that were exported from Panoply.

The gif directory contains the gif created from the NWW3 data.
